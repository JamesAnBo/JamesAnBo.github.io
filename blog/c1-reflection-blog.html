    		<li><h2>Whats your take on the EDA experience?</h2></li>
        	<li><p>I really like the emphasis on working together. I look forward to working together. It seems to promote a attitude of empowering each other rather then a fully competitive environment.</p></li>
        	<li><h2>What are your impressions?</h2></li>
        	<li><p>I'm optimistic. I think I have a lot to learn. Not just about web development, but about how to work in this environment.</p></li>
        	<li><h2>How do you see yourself engaging in this type of culture?</h2></li>
        	<li><p>I'm looking forward to it! I hope that I can both learn and help teach as we go forward. I've struggled before in keeping up but I plan to make that a problem of the past.</p></li>
        	<li><h2>Have your expectations of EDA changed? If so, how?</h2></li>
        	<li><p>My expectations of EDA havn't changed; But my expectations of myself have. I feel that I need to focus and stop procrastinating.</p></li>
			<li><h2>Are you excited to participate in this kind of learning environment? Does it make you nervous?</h2></li>
			<li><p>It does make me nervous. I know that I have trouble asking for help at times. And that I need to change that.</p></li>
