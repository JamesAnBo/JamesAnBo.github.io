        <li><h2>Which timebox and habit techniques did you try?</h2></li>
        <li><p>I've tried meditiation and pomodoro.</p></li>
        <li><h2>what did you find interesting?</h2></li>
        <li><p>I really like the concepts of the growth mindset. As well as the pomodoro technique. I feel some of the Fogg Method comes across as common sense. But it really is easier said then done when changing a habit.</p></li>
        <li><h2>which will you experiment further with?</h2></li>
        <li><p>I will definintely continue meditation. I find it very relaxing and I often find clearing my mind to help get me back into a good work ethic. I found the pomadoro method didn't work as well as I had hoped. even timing myself I find it very hard to return to work after a break. So I think it's easier for me to work in blocks of several hours. I have enjoyed reading about the counterproductive methods and plan to try them out.</p></li>
